for a day to day basis. The idea is to make it sufficiently flexible to easily fit the needs
of various users. 

## General requirements/summary
 1. Saved calendar with all the info of every day accessible
 2. For each day, have a schedule of the daily tasks split in segments with a 5 mins precision 
 3. For each day, record mood ratings and comments. By default, this should include:
    - Hours of sleep
    - Hapiness rating from 1 to 10
    - Energy rating from 1 to 10 
    - Extra notes section
 4. Flexible user experience. That is, all the mood related fields must be customizable. 
    The user must be able to delete them, add some new ones, modify their name, content style or signification


## Platform requirements
 1. The most important platform would be a responsive website, since it's most flexible.
    Any one's of the followings would just be a plus
 2. Cellphone app
 3. Desktop app

## Scheduling requrements
 1. Precision : To begin, an hourly precision is acceptable. For the finished product, a 5 mins precision is required. Should'nt be more precise than by the minute.
 2. Visual : It needs to be as simple as possible. Customizabilty would be a plus, but not essential. The format should be in the form of a time ascending list. For desktop screens, the schedule should on the left (refer to the design image reference) and the mood recordings on the right and under. For smaller devices, the schedule should be on the top of the page and the mood recordings under.
